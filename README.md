# 👋 Hello, I'm Omar Ryan

I'm a cybersecurity student with hands-on experience building and monitoring security environments. I enjoy analyzing logs, detecting attacks, and leveraging cloud & SIEM tools to understand real-world threats. My goal is to bring my technical skills and curiosity to a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Analyst**.
