# 👋 Hello, I'm Omar Ryan

I'm a cybersecurity student with hands-on experience building and monitoring security environments. I enjoy analyzing logs, detecting attacks, and leveraging cloud & SIEM tools to understand real-world threats. My goal is to bring my technical skills and curiosity to a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Analyst**.

## 🎯 Objective
To join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Security Analyst, where I can apply my knowledge of SIEM tools, network defense, and threat analysis to help detect and respond to security incidents in real time.
